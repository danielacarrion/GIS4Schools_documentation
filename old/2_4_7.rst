Rasterization
=============

In the last part of this exercise session we are going to show how to rasterize a vector file, that is, how to convert a vector layer into a raster layer. The shapefile that we are going to convert is “Temperature.shp” (corresponding to a layer of points).

In order to convert a vector file to a raster file in QGIS, the tool **Rasterize** may be used: in the main menu, select **Raster > Conversion > Rasterize (Vector to Raster)**. Select as **Input layer** “Temperature”; select “value” as **Field to use for a burn-in value** (this option defines the attribute field from which the attributes for the pixels should be chosen). Select **Pixels** as **Output raster size units** (this means that the geometric resolution that is going to be defined is expressed in pixels and not in georeferenced units). Specify the value 1000 for both **Width/Horizontal resolution** and **Height/Vertical resolution**. Choose the adequate raster extent, by clicking on the ellipses symbol in the **Output extent** space and selecting **Calculate from layer > Temperature** (in this way, the resulting raster file will have the same spatial extent as the original vector file). Finally, choose the proper file path and name (for example, “Temperature_raster”) and click **Run**: the raster will be saved in TIFF format.
