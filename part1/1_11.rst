Atlases
=======

Now that you have seen the importance of both styling and map layout, Atlases can be introduced. The purpose of Atlases is to create many maps with the same template in an automatic way, saving a considerable amount of time in respect to a manual operation. QGIS Atlas allows you to create multiple maps using the records of a vector layer. After selecting a map layer as your index (coverage) layer, a page corresponding to each of its features is generated.  QGIS Atlas dynamically adapts the content of the different layout items to each feature in the index layer.

The following layers resulting from the previous steps will be now used to illustrate how to construct an Atlas:

- Municipalities.gkpg (polygons representing the boundaries of the municipalities, including the Province and the Population attributes);

- River_network.shp (lines representing the river network across the lakes basins);

- Temperature_raster (raster representing the lakes surface water temperature).

To start, add both Vector and Raster layers (:numref:`1.11.1`, **1**) to your project. Before creating a new Layout, select the *Temperature_raster* in the **Layers Panel (2)** to modify its symbology. Instead of opening the layers properties, we can also right-click on one of the upper toolbars and flag the box of the **Layer Styling Panel (3)** to visualize it on the right. From here you can modify the symbology of every layer while looking at the map. Select the *Singleband Pseudocolor* representation from the drop-down menu **(4)** and modify the threshold values (10.75; 13.5; 16.5; 19.25; 22) to have a simpler and shorter legend later **(5)**. Select then the *River_Network* layer and set its symbology as in the example (light blue continuous line of 1mm width). Click then on the **New Print Layout** icon **(6)** to open the **Create print layout Title** window **(7)**. Define a title (“Atlas” in this the example) and press **OK (8)**.

.. _1.11.1:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.1.jpg
   
    -- Add layers, change symbology and create a new layout

A new window with the Layout interface will open (:numref:`1.11.2`). Before approaching the Atlas logic, click on **View (1)** and then on **Show Grid** and **Snap to Grid (2)** to visualize a background grid and activate the snaps to its nodes. This will facilitate the creation of new items with appropriate spacing and alignments. In the *Items* column, click on the **Atlas** section among the four available **(3)**. After flagging **Generate an Atlas (4)** the *Configuration* and *Output* sub-sections will become editable and the **Atlas Preview** icon **(5)** visible. Select the *Municipalities* layer as **Coverage layer (6)** and its attribute *name* as **Page name (7)**. Please note that the coverage layer can only be a vector.

.. _1.11.2:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.2.jpg
   
    -- Grid view and snap, Atlas creation and settings

Refer to :numref:`1.11.3` steps and result. Right clicking on a point on the white canvas **(1)** and select **Page Properties (2)**. In the **Item Properties** section **(3)** you have the possibility of changing page **Size** and **Orientation (4)**, choosing among international formats, or defining customized measures. For this exercise, select an *A3 Landscape page*. After that, add to the layout all the items that you have seen in section :ref:`1.9 <1.9>` (map, title, legend, scale bar and north arrow) as shown in the example.

.. _1.11.3:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.3.jpg
   
    -- Add items to layout and set page size

Now that the elements are in place it’s time to modify their properties to let the atlas control their content. Click on the white arrow in the left *Toolbox* to enter the **Select/Move item** mode (:numref:`1.11.4`, **1**) and then click on the map **(2)**. In the Item properties section, you are now able to change all the settings of the selected item. For the Map item, flag the **Controlled by Atlas** checkbox **(3)** and select the first visualization option among the three available below **(4)**. In this way, the map of every single page will be centered on the corresponding feature of the coverage layer (*Municipalities*), leaving a margin corresponding to the 25% of the image from the map frame, that can be activated by flagging the **Frame** checkbox **(5)**.

.. _1.11.4:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.4.jpg
   
    -- Atlas control on map item through item properties

We proceed with the Title (:numref:`1.11.5`). As done before, select the title item on the map and look at the Item properties section. The default content is the *Lorem ipsum* text that has to be deleted. To make a dynamic title, adapting to the map content, we need to define it as an expression **(2)**. Open the **Insert Expression** window **(3)**, type in the expression space the following one **(4)** and press **OK (5)**:

::

    concat("name", ' (', "province", ')')

This expression literally means to write the *Municipality* name followed by the corresponding *province* between brackets. The "..." identify the field of a layer while the '...' identify text strings. Finally go in the *Appearance* section and increase **Font size** up to 30 points **(6)**.

The other elements don’t need particular settings except for some graphical preferences that can be defined later. Now the Atlas is properly set but the symbology of the layers is still independent of it. We now want to set a different symbology for the active feature of the *Municipalities* layer in respect to the other features of the same layer. Leave the *Layout* window and go back to the main *QGIS* one. Select the *Municipalities* layer in the **Layer Panel (1)** and in the Layer Styling Panel select a **Rule-Based Symbology** (see :numref:`1.11.7`, **1**). Add a *new rule* by clicking on the green **+** symbol **(2)** and double click on the record that appears **(3)** to enter the **Edit Rule** mode. You can now define a **Label** (:numref:`1.11.6`, **2**, *Active*) and a criterion through an expression **(3)** for this rule. Click on the **ε** symbol to open the Expression String Builder window and type the following one **(4)**:

.. _2:

::

    $id = @atlas_featureid

In this way, the active atlas feature has been separated from the others and a dedicated symbology can be now defined in the *Symbol* section. Set *Fill style* as *no brush*, *Stroke colour* as *red* and *Stroke width* as *2mm* **(5)** and click on **Apply (6)**. On the map, you can now see a preview of the symbology for the active feature **(7)**.

.. _1.11.6:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.6.jpg
   
    -- Rule-based symbology for vector layer, identifying atlas active feature

Refer to :numref:`1.11.7` steps and results. Repeat the same operation to set another symbology for the remaining features. In this case, the expression will be:

::

    $id is not @atlas_featureid

The symbology will be instead a *solid white Fill* with *80% opacity*, to be set directly in the color definition, with a *black continuous stroke* of *0.5mm* of *width*. As now we have different symbologies within the same layer, we may need to define which of the two should be represented first. Click on **Symbol Levels (4)** and type *1* for the active layer, leaving *0* for the other. In this way, the active layer will be drawn later, going so on the top of the others **(5)**.

.. _1.11.7:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.7.jpg
   
    -- Rule-based symbology, symbol levels definition for visualisation priority

The same logic can be applied to the visualisation of *Labels*. In :numref:`1.11.8` is shown how to insert a **Description (1**, Pop **)**, a **Filter** or criterion for the rule **(2**, :ref:`expression [2] <2>` **)** and in the *Labels* section, the content of the label with a **Value (3)** choosing the *population* attribute from the drop-down menu. In the **Text** section **(4)** modify the *Size* setting it to 20 points and in the **Background** section **(5)** flag the **Draw Background** checkbox **(6)** and define the *Size* on *X* and *Y* direction for the buffer **(7**, *2mm* **)**. In this way, a rectangular white box slightly exceeding the label text will be generated, as visible on the map **(8)**. Before going back to the *Layout*, we can add a background map. Click on the *XYZ Tiles* in the *Browser panel* and right-click on **OpenStreetMap (9)** to *Add* the layer *to the project*. It will appear both on the map and on the **Layer Panel (10)** where it has to be moved at the bottom of the list. Finally, move the *Municipalities* layer at the top of the list, above *Temperature_raster*.

.. _1.11.8:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.8.jpg
   
    -- Rule-based label and add OpenStreetMap as background

To conclude the exercise, go back to the *Layout* and define the properties of the remaining items starting from the **Legend** (:numref:`1.11.9` **a**). Select it **(1)**, add *Legend* as **Title (2)** and set its **Size** to *24* **(3)**, the *sub-headings* one to *18* **(4)** and the *item* one to *14*.

Similarly, select the **Scale bar (1)** and modify its style to *Line Ticks Up* **(2)** and increase its **Font** size to *14* points (:numref:`1.11.9` **b**).

.. _1.11.9:
.. figure:: /img/1/1.11.9.jpg
   
    -- a) Legend properties edit; b) Scale bar properties edit

The Atlas is finally complete. To start navigating its pages click on the **Preview Atlas** icon (:numref:`1.11.10`, **1)** and use the arrows **(2)** to move one or all steps backward or forward. Alternatively you can directly select from the drop-down menu **(3)** the specific page that you are looking for. This result can be easily exported as :kbd:`.pdf`, :kbd:`.svg` and :kbd:`.jpg` clicking on the **Export Atlas** icon on the right **(4)**.
