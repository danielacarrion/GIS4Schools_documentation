Removing NoData
===============

Turn back to the original *Land_Cover* layer on which you have applied the *Land_Cover_style*, provided to you in the exercise folder. As already noticed during the *Raster visualization on QGIS* **TODO internal link** exercise, this style contains more classes and values than the ones really present in this area, because it was created for the whole *Corine Land Cover map* that is much wider than this portion we are referring to. Particularly, the *Land_Cover_style* 999-NODATA class, corresponding to value 48, is not present in our area under study, you can check it by visualizing the raster with *Singleband-grey* render type, to see it contains no pixels with value 48. Therefore, you can remove this class visualization from *Land_Cover_style*, by clicking on **minus** icon (see :numref:`2.5.2.1` **(2)**) and you can re-save the style.

There is another huge difference when visualizing this raster with *Singleband-grey* render type: the *Land_Cover* layer contains pixels with 0 value that are no more visible when loading again the *Land_Cover_style*. See :numref:`2.5.2.1` to follow the steps to visualize them also with the *Land_Cover_style*: use the **+** button **(3)** in the **Properties→Simbology** window, to add a new class to be visualized: by assigning to it value 0, *NoData* label and an evident color as black **(4)**, you will see again, on borders, black pixels with 0 value that will appear also with this *Land_Cover_style*.

These black pixels are due to a previous conversion from Coordinate Reference System to a projection, during which they have remained empty. It is preferable to change their 0 value with **null** value, in a way to exclude them from following calculations. See on :numref:`2.5.2.2` the operations to be made. Go to **Processing Toolbox(1)→GRASS→Raster→r.null (2)** and open **r.null** window where it is requested the raster map for which to edit null values **(3)** (*Land_Cover [EPSG:32632]*), the list of cell values to be set to null **(4)** (here type 0) and finally where to save the new raster file. By clicking on Run, a new raster will be created without the 0 value pixels.
