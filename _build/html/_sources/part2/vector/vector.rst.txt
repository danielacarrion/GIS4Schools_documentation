Vector processing
=================

In this lecture we will introduce some common tools available on QGIS for the analysis and processing of vector data. QGIS provides different functions for the management and analysis of vector data, such as tools for map digitizing, features research and selection, editing and geoprocessing. We are going to use the following vector files:

- Lakes.shp (polygons representing the main lakes of the area of interest);

- River_network.shp (lines representing the river network across the lakes basins);

- Municipalities_OSM.shp (polygons representing the boundaries of the municipalities);

- Temperature.shp (points representing the lakes surface water temperature).
