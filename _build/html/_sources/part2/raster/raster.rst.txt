Raster processing
=================

The aim of this exercise is to provide you some skills about raster data analysis and processing, starting by some very basic tools on QGIS that can help in it. During this exercise we will use the following layers that you have already been working with:

- **Raster Data:**

   - *Land_cover*
   - *Temperature_distribution*

- **Vector Data**, to be used for the overlay analysis:

   - *Municipalities_OSM*

Load them on your QGIS by dragging and dropping them from the GIS4Schools_GeoPackage.gpkg connection to your **Layers panel**. It is advisable to load also the raster data styles that you were given in the exercise folder (see exercise on *raster visualization on QGIS* **TODO internal link**) in a way to better visualize the data while analysing and processing them.

This exercise will start from some basic activities and checks that are usually taken before processing (as reprojection and removing noData) to follow then with operations and tools that can be very useful when working with raster data as Raster calculator, vectorization, clip and overlay statistics. All these operations and tools can be used separately, in different order or in different ways, they are just tools to, in the end, get a result, some geospatial information, from your raster data.
