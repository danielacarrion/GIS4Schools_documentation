How to select the correct products with Sentinel Hub EO Browser
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Once logged in the `Sentinel Hub EO Browser <https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/eobrowser/>`_, configure the search criteria (:numref:`Fig3_EObrowser`):

1. In this example, we look for Sentinel-2 images. Thus, select :guilabel:`Sentinel-2` as a data source,

2. Set :guilabel:`Advanced search` and select :guilabel:`L2A (atmospherically corrected)`. This option limits the search to atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 images only,

3. Optionally, set the :guilabel:`Max. cloud coverage` to the desired level of maximum cloud cover accepted,

4. Select the starting and ending :guilabel:`Time range [UTC]` by clicking the calendars,

5. Optionally, select :guilabel:`filter by months` to limit the search to specific months in the time range,

6. Click the :guilabel:`Search` button to search the archive.

.. _Fig3_EObrowser:

	Set the searching criteria.

.. warning:: **Remember to use ONLY atmospherically corrected images!** |br|
	Multispectral satellite images capture both the sunlight reflected by the Earth’s surface and the light scattered by the atmosphere. However, when monitoring the environment, atmospheric scattering is a noise that must be removed before image manipulation or analysis. |br|
	Sentinel-2 data provided as ``L1C`` products are uncorrected images. Sentinel-2 data provided as ``L2A`` products are atmospherically corrected images. |br|
	**Only** ``L2A`` **products are ready for image processing!**

How to view the satellite images with Sentinel Hub EO Browser
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Select your image tile in the main window and click :guilabel:`Visualize`. Alternatively, you can load your image by clicking :guilabel:`Visualize` in the left panel (:numref:`Fig6_EObrowser`).

.. _Fig6_EObrowser:
.. figure:: /img/3/Fig6_EObrowser-2.png
	:align: center

	Select your satellite image archived in the Sentinel Hub EO Browser.

By default, `Sentinel Hub EO Browser <https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/eobrowser/>`_ opens a *true colour image* of the selected area (:numref:`Fig7_EObrowser`). For `Sentinel-2 <https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2>`_, the Red, Green and Blue colours are recorded by spectral band 4, band 3, and band 2. Therefore, the Earth’s surface is shown as humans would see it naturally.

.. _Fig7_EObrowser:
.. figure:: /img/3/Fig7_EObrowser.png
	:align: center

	The satellite image(s) are displayed.

.. note:: **True colour synthesis:** |br|
	Satellite Red band → Image Red colour channel |br|
	Satellite Green band → Image Green colour channel |br|
	Satellite Blue band → Image Blue colour channel

However, `Sentinel Hub EO Browser <https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/eobrowser/>`_ shows the following additional pre-built colour composites:

- **False colour** (:numref:`Fig8_EObrowser`). This is the well-know colour composite used to evaluate vegetation biomass and health. It uses the near infrared (NIR), Red, and Green spectral bands, represented as Red, Green and Blue colours respectively:

	- Vegetation is from dark red to light red,
	- Urban areas are cyan or tan,
	- Bare soils are from dark brown to light brown,
	- Water is black or dark blue,
	- Snow and ice are cyan or blue,
	- Wildfires are white (the smoke plume).

.. _Fig8_EObrowser:

	False colour composite.

.. note:: **False colour synthesis:** |br|
	Satellite NIR band → Image Red colour channel |br|
	Satellite Red band → Image Green colour channel |br|
	Satellite Green band → Image Blue colour channel

- **False colour (urban)** (:numref:`Fig15_EObrowser`). This colour composite is used to highlight details in the urbanized areas more clearly and spot wildfires. It uses two shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands and the Red spectral bands, represented as Red, Green and Blue colours respectively:

	- Vegetation is green,
	- Urban areas are white, grey, or purple,
	- Bare soils are shown in a variety of colours,
	- Water is black or dark blue,
	- Wildfires are red and yellow.

.. note:: **False colour (urban) synthesis:** |br|
	Satellite SWIR band 1 → Image Red colour channel |br|
	Satellite SWIR band 2 → Image Green colour channel |br|
	Satellite Red band → Image Blue colour channel

- **SWIR** (:numref:`Fig16_EObrowser`). This colour composite is used to distinguish between clouds, snow, and ice. Besides, it is useful for geological mapping. It uses a shortwave infrared (SWIR), a near infrared (NIR) and the red spectral bands, represented as red, green and blue colours respectively:

	- Vegetation is red,
	- Urban areas are cyan,
	- Bare soils are from dark brown to light brown,
	- Water is black or dark blue,
	- Snow and ice are blue,
	- Rocks are shown in a variety of colours.

`Sentinel Hub EO Browser <https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/eobrowser/>`_ also shows the maps of some basic spectral indices. These parameters are useful to recognize different land cover types and monitor the status of vegetated land. Specifically:

- **NDVI** (:numref:`Fig9_EObrowser`). The *Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)* is the basic greenness vegetation index used to estimate biomass and health of the green vegetation. The index is calculated using a combination of the near infrared (NIR) and red spectral bands:

	- Dense and healthy vegetation is dark green,
	- Sparse or unhealthy vegetation is light green.

.. math:: NDVI=\frac{\rho_{NIR}-\rho_{Red}}{\rho_{NIR}+\rho_{Red}}

.. _Fig9_EObrowser:

	:align: center

	Map of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

- **Moisture index** (:numref:`Fig17_EObrowser`). The *Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)* is used to estimate vegetation water content and monitor droughts. The index is calculated using a combination of the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands:

	- Vegetation (on land) without water stress is dark blue.

.. math:: NDMI=\frac{\rho_{NIR}-\rho_{SWIR}}{\rho_{NIR}+\rho_{SWIR}}

.. _Fig17_EObrowser:

	Map of the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI).

- **NDWI** (:numref:`Fig18_EObrowser`). The *Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)* is used to map water bodies. The index is calculated using a combination of the near infrared (NIR) and green spectral bands:

	- Water bodies are blue.

.. math:: NDWI=\frac{\rho_{Green}-\rho_{NIR}}{\rho_{Green}+\rho_{NIR}}

.. _Fig18_EObrowser:
.. figure:: /img/3/Fig18_EObrowser.png
	:align: center

	Map of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).

- **NDSI** (:numref:`Fig19_EObrowser`). The *Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI)* is used to map clouds and snow. The index is calculated using a combination of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and green spectral bands:

	- Clouds are white,
	- Snow (and water) is light blue.

.. _Fig19_EObrowser:

.. math:: NDSI=\frac{\rho_{Green}-\rho_{SWIR}}{\rho_{Green}+\rho_{SWIR}}

Additionally, there is a simple scene classification map with 9 land cover classes (:numref:`Fig10_EObrowser`).
